## Types of design patterns

There are three main types of design patterns:

1. Structural design pattern: Describes how objects are composed and combined to form larger structures. 

Examples of structural design patterns include Model-View- Controller (MVC), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Facade.


2. Behavioral design pattern: Describes how objects communicate with each other. 

Examples of behavioral design patterns are Delegation, Strategy and Observer.


3. Creational design pattern: Describes how to create or instantiate objects. 

Examples of creational patterns are Builder, Singleton and Prototype.
