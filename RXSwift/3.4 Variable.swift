/*
 Last subject to look at, which is a wrapper around another type of subject not a complete new one. Itâ€™s called a variable. What makes a variable special is that it is guaranteed to not terminate with an error. When a variable instance is about to be de-allocated it will automatically emit a completed event. We create a variable by passing an initial value to its initializer. Because the variable is a wrapper around the behavior subject, it will automatically replay only the last value to new subscribers.
